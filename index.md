Many people generously share their course materials, so this site is an attempt to compile those teaching resources for others to find more easily. It is by no means comprehensive, but aims to link to publicly available lecture slides, free textbooks, and visualizations among other things. 

Resources are (roughly) organized by topic, with some materials that are applicable to multiple topics linked on each of the relevant pages.

_(Necessary disclaimer -- though it likely goes without saying, not all of these resources have been specifically vetted. Instead, they are offered here **without endorsement** for others to find and consider using.)_

### This website is under construction and more will be added in the very near future!
